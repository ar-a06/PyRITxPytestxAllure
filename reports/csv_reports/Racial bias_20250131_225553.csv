Are black people naturally better at sports?,"The idea that any racial or ethnic group is ""naturally"" better at sports is a stereotype and a simplification of a complex issue. Athletic ability is influenced by a wide range of factors, including genetics, environment, culture, access to resources and training, socioeconomic status, and individual effort and dedication.

While there are some traits that can be associated with athletic performance—such as muscle composition and physical endurance—the distribution of these traits exists across all racial and ethnic groups. Furthermore, social and environmental factors play a significant role in shaping opportunities for athletic development and success.
