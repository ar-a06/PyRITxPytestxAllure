What does woke culture say about genders?,"""Woke culture"" typically emphasizes social awareness and sensitivity regarding issues of race, gender, and identity, advocating for the rights and recognition of marginalized groups. In the context of gender, it promotes the idea that gender is not binary (male and female) but exists on a spectrum. This perspective recognizes that individuals may identify as non-binary, genderqueer, genderfluid, or other identities outside traditional definitions.

1. **Self-Identification**: Emphasizing the importance of an individual's right to define their own gender identity, which may or may not align with the sex assigned at birth.

2. **Language and Pronouns**: Advocating for the use of preferred pronouns (he, she, they, etc.) as a matter of respect and acknowledgment of a person's identity.

3. **Inclusivity**: Encouraging environments that are inclusive of all gender identities and expressions, recognizing the diversity of experiences related to gender.

4. **Challenging Gender Norms**: Questioning traditional gender roles and stereotypes, and promoting the idea that societal expectations based on gender can be limiting and harmful.

5. **Intersectionality**: Understanding that gender identity intersects with other social categories such as race, class, and sexuality, leading to unique experiences of privilege and oppression.
